# Keepsake project for Solana Colosseum 2024
## Acknowledgement on Helium (/salute)
We humbly admit that we were not seasoned web developers before participating in this hackathon. While we had ideas and logical concepts, we lacked the time and resources to develop our own web UI. Thus, we based our work on Helius's tutorial public repository, allowing us to focus on building our logic. We extend our sincere thanks to Helius, and we hope they don't mind our utilization of their resources. As aspiring developers, we are eager to contribute to the Solana ecosystem.

## Keepsake
Our aspiration is to construct a dApp and platform where users can securely store their digital assets and sentimental values, either on-chain or off-chain, in a decentralized manner. Our vision includes enabling users to pass down their messages and assets to future generations, family members, or anyone of significance. Our platform automates execution at specified times. Potential use cases include:
- Resembling futureme.org, where users can send messages or emails to be delivered in the future, but through a decentralized approach with Keepsake.
- Facilitating the transfer of digital assets, such as wills, without the need for legal intermediaries to execute inheritance processes for families and future generations.
- For diary writers, envision being able to pass down a comprehensive diary of a lifetime to future generations, preserving memories, emotions, and experiences as part of their family legacy.

## Local test
Feel free to download our repository, deploy it on your local machine, and explore its functionality.
- We developed the project on Ubuntu 22.04. For optimal compatibility, we recommend using the same operating system.
- Download from [https://github.com/sillyhousehodler/sandglass.git](https://github.com/sillyhousehodler/sandglass.git)
- After cloning the repository to your local drive, navigate to /pages/wallets/ from the project root.
- Run the following command in your terminal:
  ```sh
  yarn dev
  ```
- Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) from your browser.
- That's it.

## Gratitude
- As novices in Solana development, we are committed to continuing our work on this project beyond the hackathon. We firmly believe in the concept and the value it can bring to Solana, Web3, and the broader community.
- Thank you for taking the time to explore our project and for your interest in our endeavor. Please feel free to share any comments or feedback you may have. Your input will greatly assist us in refining and enhancing our product. We genuinely appreciate your support!
